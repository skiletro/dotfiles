# dotfiles
my dotfiles.

requires `i3-gaps`, `rofi`, `pywal`, and other shit. i'll document this more when i feel like it.

i'm currently working on this on debian buster (10.2.0), installed a default gnome desktop then installed i3 and everything else on top of that.

if you see any errors in my configs, please let me know because im terrible at this stuff.

ps: if its needed, the current wallpaper gets saved to `~/.wall.png` then the pywal shit gets applied to that, dodgy but it works.
